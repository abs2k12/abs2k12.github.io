I am currently a PhD student working under the supervision of [Dr. Mirek Giersz](https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/people/staff/mig/) at the [Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center](https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/) of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland. I primarily work on various topics connected with the evolution of dense stellar systems like globular clusters using the [MOCCA code](https://moccacode.net/) for star cluster simulations. My research focuses on populations of various exotic objects and peculiar binary systems in globular clusters.

I am originally from [Lahore, Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore) where I completed my higher secondary education in 2006. In Fall 2016, I moved to Utrecht in the Netherlands where I received a scholarship to study at [University College Utrecht (UCU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Utrecht) of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht). In 2009, I graduated from UCU with a double-major in physical sciences (math, physics and astronomy) and humanities (philosophy, religious studies and history). Following UCU, I briefly spent a semester in 2010 studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Starting in fall 2010, I was selected for the Erasmus Mundus programme called "[Astromundus](www.astromundus.eu/)", this was a 2 year masters in astronomy and astrophysics offered by a consortium of 5 universities. During this masters course I studied at the universities of Innsbruck (Austria), Padova (Italy) and Belgrade (Serbia). In November 2013, I moved to Warsaw, Poland to start my PhD with Mirek Giersz.
